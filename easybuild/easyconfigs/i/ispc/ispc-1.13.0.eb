 SIMD programming on the CPU. ispc is a compiler for a variant of the C programming language,
 with extensions for 'single program, multiple data' (SPMD) programming.
 Under the SPMD model, the programmer writes a program that generally appears
 to be a regular serial program, though the execution model is actually that
 a number of program instances execute in parallel on the hardware."""
