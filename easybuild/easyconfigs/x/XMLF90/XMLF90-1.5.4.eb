description = """xmlf90 is a suite of libraries to handle XML in Fortran. 
 It has two major components:
 - A XML parsing library. The parser was designed to be a useful tool in the extraction and analysis of data in the context of scientific computing, and thus the priorities were efficiency and the ability to deal with very large XML files while maintaining a small memory footprint. The most complete programming interface is based on the very successful SAX (Simple API for XML) model, although a partial DOM interface and a very experimental XPATH interface are also present.
 - A library (xmlf90-wxml) that facilitates the writing of well-formed XML, including such features as automatic start-tag completion, attribute pretty-printing, and element indentation. There are also helper routines to handle the output of numerical arrays."""
