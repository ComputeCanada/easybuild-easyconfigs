Nearly Infinite Neighbor Joining Application

Compute correct neighbor-joining phylogenies for inputs of more than 10,000
 sequences.  This is a C++/SSE port
of the original Java code described in:

Wheeler, T.J. 2009. Large-scale neighbor-joining with NINJA. In S.L. Salzberg
 and T. Warnow (Eds.), 
Proceedings of the 9th Workshop on Algorithms in Bioinformatics. 
WABI 2009, pp. 375-389. Springer, Berlin. (LNCS webpage,preprint)

The Java version of NINJA was the fastest available tool computing 
neighbor-joining phylogenies ( 10x faster than the fastest implemenation of 
the canonical neighbor-joining algorithm - QuickTree ) at the time of it's 
release.

In addition to generating phylogenies, Ninja can be used to output pairwise 
distances using several common sequence distance measures, and cluster 
sequences using a nearest-neighbor approach.
