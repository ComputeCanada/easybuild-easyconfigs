description = """This repository contains an implementation of the EEMS method for analyzing and visualizing spatial population structure from geo-referenced genetic samples. EEMS uses the concept of effective migration to model the relationship between genetics and geography, and it outputs an estimated effective migration surface (hence, EEMS) - a visual representation of population structure that can highlight potential regions of higher-than-average and lower-than-average historic gene flow."""
