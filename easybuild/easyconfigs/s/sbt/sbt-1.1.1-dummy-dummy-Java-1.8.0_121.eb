 sbt uses a small number of concepts to support flexible and powerful build definitions. There are not that many concepts, but sbt is not exactly like other build systems and there are details you will stumble on if you haven t read the documentation.
 The Getting Started Guide covers the concepts you need to know to create and maintain an sbt build definition.
 It is highly recommended to read the Getting Started Guide."""
