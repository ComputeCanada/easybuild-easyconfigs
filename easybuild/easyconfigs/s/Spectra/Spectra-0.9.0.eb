description = """
Spectra stands for Sparse Eigenvalue Computation Toolkit as a Redesigned ARPACK. It is a C++ library for large scale eigenvalue problems, built on top of Eigen, an open source linear algebra library.

Spectra is implemented as a header-only C++ library, whose only dependency, Eigen, is also header-only. Hence Spectra can be easily embedded in C++ projects that require calculating eigenvalues of large matrices.
