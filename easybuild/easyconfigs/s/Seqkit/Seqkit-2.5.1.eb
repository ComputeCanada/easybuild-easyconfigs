description = """FASTA and FASTQ are basic and ubiquitous formats for storing
 nucleotide and protein sequences. Common manipulations of FASTA/Q file
include converting, searching, filtering, deduplication, splitting, shuffling,
 and sampling. Existing tools only implement some of these manipulations,
and not particularly efficiently, and some are only available for certain
operating systems. Furthermore, the complicated installation process of
required packages and running environments can render these programs less user
 friendly.

This project describes a cross-platform ultrafast comprehensive toolkit for
FASTA/Q processing. SeqKit provides executable binary files for all major
operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X, and can be directly
 used without any dependencies or pre-configurations. SeqKit demonstrates
competitive performance in execution time and memory usage compared to similar
tools. The efficiency and usability of SeqKit enable researchers to rapidly
accomplish common FASTA/Q file manipulations.
