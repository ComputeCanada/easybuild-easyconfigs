description = """Simbody is a high-performance, open-source toolkit for science- and engineering-quality 
simulation of articulated mechanisms, including biomechanical structures such as human and animal skeletons, 
mechanical systems like robots, vehicles, and machines, and anything else that can be described as a set 
of rigid bodies interconnected by joints, influenced by forces and motions, and restricted by constraints. 
Simbody includes a multibody dynamics library for modeling motion in generalized/internal coordinates in O(n) 
time. This is sometimes called a Featherstone-style physics engine.
