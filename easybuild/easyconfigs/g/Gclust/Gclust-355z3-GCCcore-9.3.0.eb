description = """Gclust software was developed to make clusters of protein sequences from all predicted protein sequences in a selected set of genomes. The clusters are homolog groups, but not ortholog clusters (see below for the distinction), and therefore, contain all homologous sequences encoded by the selected genomes. An ortholog cluster, such as the one in KEGG Orthologs or COG in NCBI, contains only a single sequence for each genome, and such a single representative is usually selected by a criterion called bi-directional best  hit"""
