GenMap - Fast and Exact Computation of Genome Mappability

GenMap computes the uniqueness of k-mers for each position in the genome while allowing for up to e mismatches. More formally, the uniqueness or (k,e)-mappability can be described for every position as the reciprocal value of how often each k-mer occurs approximately in the genome, i.e., with up to e mismatches. Hence, a mappability value of 1 at position i indicates that the k-mer in the sequence at position i occurs only once in the sequence with up to e errors. A low mappability value indicates that this k-mer belongs to a repetitive region. GenMap can be applied to single or multiple genomes and helps finding regions that are unique or shared by many or all genomes.
