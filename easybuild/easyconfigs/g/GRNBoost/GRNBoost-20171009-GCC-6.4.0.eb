description = """GRNBoost is a library built on top of Apache Spark that implements a scalable strategy for gene regulatory network (GRN) inference. Inferring a gene regulatory network (GRN) from gene expression data is a computationally expensive task, exacerbated by increasing data sizes due to advances in high-throughput gene profiling technology.
 GRNBoost was inspired by GENIE3, a popular algorithm for GRN inference. GENIE3 breaks up the inference problem into a number of tree-based ensemble (Random Forest) nonlinear regressions, building a predictive model for the expression profile of each gene in the dataset in function of the expression profiles of a collection of candidate regulatory genes (transcription factors). The regression models act as a feature selection mechanism, they yield the most predictive regulators for the target genes as candidate links in the resulting gene regulatory network.."""
