description = """
GLIMPSE is a phasing and imputation method for large-scale low-coverage sequencing studies.

Main features of the method:

1. Accurate imputed genotype calls. Our method takes advantage of reference panels to produce high quality genotype calls.
2. Accurate phasing. GLIMPSE outputs accurate phased haplotypes for the low-coverage sequenced dataset.
3. Low-coverage sequencing outperforms SNP arrays. Imputation using low-coverage sequencing data is competitive to SNP array imputation. Results for European and African-American populations are interactively available on the website.
4. A cost-effective paradigm. GLIMPSE realises whole genome imputation from the HRC reference panel for less than 1$.
5. An easy-to-use framework for diploid, haploid and mixed ploidy imputation. Our method is able to perform imputation of samples with different ploidy without the need to split the data.
