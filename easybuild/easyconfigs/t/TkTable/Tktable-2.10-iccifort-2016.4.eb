description = """Tcl is a simple-to-learn yet very powerful language. Its syntax is described in just a dozen rules, but it has all the features needed to rapidly create useful programs in almost any field of application - on a wide variety of international platforms. Tk is a graphical toolkit for Tcl. It allows you to develop graphical applications that run on Windows, Linux, MacOS X and many other platforms. And not just from Tcl - Tk can be used from many languages including C, Ruby, Perl, Python and Lua."""
