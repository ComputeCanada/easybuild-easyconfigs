description = """
Detector response to a high-energy physics process is often estimated by Monte Carlo simulation. For purposes of data analysis, the results of this simulation are typically stored in large multi-dimensional histograms, which can quickly become unwieldy in terms of size or numerically problematic due to unfilled bins or interpolation artifacts. Photospline is a library that uses the penalized spline technique to efficiently compute, store, and evaluate B-spline representations of such tables.
