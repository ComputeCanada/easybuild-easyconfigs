description = """PRIMME, pronounced as prime, is a high-performance library for computing a few eigenvalues/eigenvectors, and singular values/vectors.
PRIMME is especially optimized for large, difficult problems.
Real symmetric and complex Hermitian problems, standard A x = \lambda x and generalized A x = \lambda B x, are supported.
Besides, standard eigenvalue problems with a normal matrix are supported.
It can find largest, smallest, or interior singular/eigenvalues, and can use preconditioning to accelerate convergence.
