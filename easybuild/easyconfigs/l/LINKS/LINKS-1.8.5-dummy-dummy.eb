description = """LINKS is a scalable genomics application for scaffolding or re-scaffolding genome assembly drafts with long reads, such as those produced by Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd and Pacific Biosciences. It provides a generic alignment-free framework for scaffolding and can work on any sequences. It is versatile and supports not only long sequences as a source of long-range information, but also MPET pairs and linked-reads, such as those from the 10X Genomics GemCode and Chromium platform, via ARCS (http://www.bcgsc.ca/platform/bioinfo/software/arcs). Fill gaps in LINKS-derived scaffolds using Sealer (http://www.bcgsc.ca/platform/bioinfo/software/sealer)."""
