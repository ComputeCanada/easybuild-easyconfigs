description = """Long Ranger is a set of analysis pipelines that processes Chromium sequencing output to align reads and call and phase SNPs, indels, and structural variants. There are five main pipelines, each triggered by a longranger command: longranger mkfastq; longranger wgs; longranger targeted; longranger basic; longranger align. These pipelines combine Chromium-specific algorithms with widely used components such as BWA (used within the Lariat aligner) and GATK. Output is delivered in standard BAM, VCF, and BEDPE formats that are augmented with long range information."""
