description = """minimac2 is an improved version of Minimac. It is designed to work on phased 
 genotypes and can handle very large reference panels with hundreds or thousands of haplotypes. 
 The name has two parts. The first, mini, refers to the modest amount of computational resources it requires. 
 The second, mac, is short hand for MaCH, our widely used algorithm for genotype imputation."""
