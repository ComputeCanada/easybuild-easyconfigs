description = """This software implements MSMC, a method to infer population size and gene flow from multiple genome sequences (Schiffels and Durbin, 2014, Nature Genetics, or Preprint).

In short, msmc can infer

the scaled population size of a single population as a function of time
the timing and nature of population separations between two populations
from multiple phased haplotypes. When only two haplotypes are given, MSMC is similar to PSMC, and we call it PSMC' because of subtle differences in the method and the underlying model, which allows PSMC' to infer more accurately the recombination rate."""
