Mmg is an open source software for simplicial remeshing. It provides 3 applications and 4 libraries:
the mmg2d application and the libmmg2d library: adaptation and optimization of a two-dimensional
triangulation and generation of a triangulation from a set of points or from given boundary edges
the mmgs application and the libmmgs library: adaptation and optimization of a surface triangulation
and isovalue discretization the mmg3d application and the libmmg3d library: adaptation and optimization
of a tetrahedral mesh and implicit domain meshing the libmmg library gathering the libmmg2d,
libmmgs and libmmg3d libraries."""
