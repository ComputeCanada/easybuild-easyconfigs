description = """MetaMaps is tool specifically developed for the analysis of long-read (PacBio/Oxford Nanopore) metagenomic datasets.

It simultaenously carries out read assignment and sample composition estimation.

It is faster than classical exact alignment-based approaches, and its output is more information-rich than that of kmer-spectra-based methods. For example, each MetaMaps alignment comes with an approximate alignment location, an estimated alignment identity and a mapping quality.

The approximate mapping algorithm employed by MetaMaps is based on MashMap. MetaMaps adds a mapping quality model and EM-based estimation of sample composition.
