description = """Proper identification of repetitive sequences is an essential step in genome analysis. The RECON package performs de novo identification and classification of repeat sequence families from genomic sequences. The underlying algorithm is based on extensions to the usual approach of single linkage clustering of local pairwise alignments between genomic sequences. Specifically, our extensions use multiple alignment information to define the boundaries of individual copies of the repeats and to distinguish homologous but distinct repeat element families. RECON should be useful for first-pass automatic classification of repeats in newly sequenced genomes."""
