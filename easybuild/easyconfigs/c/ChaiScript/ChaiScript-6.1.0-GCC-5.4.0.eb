description = """ChaiScript is one of the only embedded scripting language designed from the ground up to directly target C++ and take advantage of modern C++ development techniques, working with the developer how they would expect it to work. Being a native C++ application, it has some advantages over existing embedded scripting languages:
 - It uses a header-only approach, which makes it easy to integrate with existing projects.
 - It maintains type safety between your C++ application and the user scripts.
 - It supports a variety of C++ techniques including callbacks, overloaded functions, class methods, and stl containers.
