description = """
Similar to FASTA/Q format in field of Bioinformatics, CSV/TSV formats are basic and ubiquitous file formats in both Bioinformatics and data science.

People usually use spreadsheet software like MS Excel to process table data. However this is all by clicking and typing, which is not automated and is time-consuming to repeat, especially when you want to apply similar operations with different datasets or purposes.

You can also accomplish some CSV/TSV manipulations using shell commands, but more code is needed to handle the header line. Shell commands do not support selecting columns with column names either.

csvtk is convenient for rapid data investigation and also easy to integrate into analysis pipelines. It could save you lots of time in (not) writing Python/R scripts.
