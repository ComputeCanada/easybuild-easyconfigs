description = """Cell Ranger is a set of analysis pipelines that process Chromium single cell 3-RNA-seq output to align reads, generate gene-cell matrices and perform clustering and gene expression analysis. Cell Ranger 1.2 and later support libraries generated by the Chromium Single Cell 3i-v1 and v2 reagent kits, whereas Cell Ranger 1.1 and earlier do not support v2 libraries.

 Cell Ranger includes four main gene expression pipelines:
 - cellranger mkfastq wraps Illumina's bcl2fastq to correctly demultiplex Chromium-prepared sequencing samples and to convert barcode and read data to FASTQ files.
 - cellranger count takes FASTQ files from cellranger mkfastq and performs alignment, filtering, and UMI counting.
 - cellranger aggr aggregates outputs from multiple runs of cellranger count, normalizing those runs to the same sequencing depth and then recomputing the gene-barcode matrices and analysis on the combined data.
 - cellranger reanalyze takes gene-barcode matrices produced by cellranger count or cellranger aggr and reruns the dimensionality reduction, clustering, and gene expression algorithms using tunable parameter settings.

These pipelines combine Chromium-specific algorithms with the widely used RNA-seq aligner STAR. Output is delivered in standard BAM, MEX, CSV, HDF5 and HTML formats that are augmented with cellular information."""
