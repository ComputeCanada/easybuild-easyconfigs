A C library that is bundled with much of the above software. C function library for sequence analysis.

SQUID is my own personal library of C functions and utility programs for sequence analysis. I don't really suggest that you use it in your programs, as I change it at will. However, it does contains some small utility programs that some people have found useful in scripts that drive large HMMER tasks."""
