# This easyconfig is to build AmberTools with  MPI and CUDA - enabled QUICK binaries 
# It can be adapted to buld PMEMD with NCCL  by fixing the following issues:
# CMake config fails to build PMEMD (and AmberTools as well) with NCCL library due to bugs in CMake scripts
# 1. FindNCCL function is never called even when NCCL build is enabled (3rdPartyTools.cmake, l.538)
# 2. The logic to check for NCCL is wrong; it emits error when NCCL is found (PMEMDCompilerFlags.cmake, l.230)
