BPP implements four methods:
* Estimation of the parameters of species divergence times and population sizes
  under the multi-species coalescent (MSC) model when the species phylogeny is given
* Inference of the species tree when the assignments are given by the user
* Species delimitation using a user-specified guide treed
* Joint species delimitation and species tree estimation
